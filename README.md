# SQL Code

SQL Code is a cross-platform SQL editor and database manager available for Linux, Mac, and Windows. SQL Code is MIT licensed so it is free (libre) and free (gratis).

Hey! Please complete my [user survey](https://forms.gle/AjXYJG4ktXYhDZUc7) to help me get to know you better (and thus focus on features that are important to you)

## Features

Top feature: It's smooth üç´, fast üèé, and you'll actually enjoy using it ü•∞

- Autocomplete SQL query editor with syntax highlighting
- Tabbed interface, so you can multitask
- Sort and filter table data to find just what you need
- Sensible keyboard-shortcuts
- Save queries for later
- Query run-history, so you can find that one query you got working 3 days ago
- Default dark theme

One of our frustrations with other open-source SQL editors and database managers is that they take a 'kitchen sink' approach to features, adding so many features that the UI becomes cluttered and hard to navigate. We wanted a good looking, open source SQL workbench that's powerful, but also easy to use. We couldn't find one, so we created it!

### Starting the Dev version of SQL Code

Want to write some code and improve SQL Code? Getting set-up is easy on Mac, Linux, or Windows.

```bash
# First: Install NodeJS 12+, NPM, and Yarn
# ...

# 1. Fork the SQL Code Repo (click fork button at top right of this screen)
# 2. Check out your fork:
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/sql-code.git sql-code
cd sql-code/
yarn install # installs dependencies

# Now you can start the app:
yarn run electron:serve ## the app will now start
```

### Where to make changes?

This repo is now a monorepo, we have several places with code, but only really a couple of important entry points.

All app code lives in `apps/studio`, some shared code lives in `shared/src`. This is shared with other apps.

SQL Code has two entry points:
- `background.js` - this is the electron-side code that controls native things like showing windows.
- `main.js` - this is the entry point for the Vue.js app. You can follow the Vue component breadcrumbs from `App.vue` to find the screen you need.

**Generally we have two 'screens':**
- ConnectionInterface - connecting to a DB
- CoreInterface - interacting with a database

### How to submit a change?

- Push your changes to your repository and open a Pull Request from our github page (this page)
- Make sure to write some notes about what your change does! A gif is always welcome for visual changes.

## Maintainer notes (casual readers can ignore this stuff)


### Release Process

1. Up the version number in package.json
2. Replace `build/release-notes.md` with the latest release notes. Follow the format that is there.
  - run `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline | grep 'Merge pull'` to find PRs merged
2. Commit
3. Push to main
4. Create a tag `git tag v<version>`. It must start with a 'v'
5. `git push origin <tagname>`
  - Now wait for the build/publish action to complete on Github
6. Push the new release live
  - Go to the new 'draft' release on the releases tab of github, edit the notes, publish
  - Log into snapcraft.io, drag the uploaded release into the 'stable' channel for each architecture.

This should also publish the latest docs

Post Release:
1. Copy release notes to a blog post, post on website
2. Tweet link
3. Share on LinkedIn
4. Send to mailing list on SendInBlue


## Big Thanks

SQL Code wouldn't exist without [Beekeeper Studio](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/) and [Sqlectron-core](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-core), the core database libraries from the [Sqlectron project](https://github.com/sqlectron/sqlectron-gui). SQL Code started as an experimental fork of that repository. A big thanks to @maxcnunes and the rest of the Sqlectron community.
